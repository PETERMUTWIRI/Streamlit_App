## Features

**Sales Prediction**: The app allows users to input the date, store number, and product family to get a sales prediction using a pre-trained XGBoost model.

**Interactive Interface**: Streamlit provides an easy-to-use, web-based interface for users to interact with the model and get predictions.

## Model Training and Saving 🤖

The XGBoost model was trained using data from the corporate favoritas chain to stores and saved as "exported_data.pkl" using XGBoost version during model training.

## Usage Instructions 🧑‍🏫

Input Fields: The app displays input fields for the date, store number, and product family.
Prediction: Click the "Predict Sales" button to get a sales prediction based on the provided inputs.
Results: The app will display the predicted sales for the specified date, store number, and product family.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

If you encounter any issues with the app, ensure that you have the required libraries installed and that the "exported_data.pkl" file is in the correct location.
Verify that the XGBoost version used for training matches the version used during deployment.
